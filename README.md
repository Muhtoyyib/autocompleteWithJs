# autocompleteWithJs
This Repository is created for the JavaScript assignment of the Interactivity with JavaScript(University of Michigan) course on Cousera. It focuses on interacting with form inputs on a webpage.

I am required to create a function to enable autocomplete of the information of an input field into another whenever a checkbox is clicked
